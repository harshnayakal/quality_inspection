# quality_inspection
This Python script performs automated quality inspection using OpenCV. It detects defects in an image by converting it to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, detecting edges with Canny, and identifying contours. Defects are highlighted, and results are displayed alongside the original image using Matplotlib.
